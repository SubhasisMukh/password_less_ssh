# password_less_ssh
# password_less_ssh
You can use this script to setup SSH without any password from your PC.
Please run the script in a Linux terminal.
For example open a terminal and run this command : # bash sshsetup.sh
First you have to enter the number of servers you want to setup passwordless ssh. Then put the username and IP address of the respective Servers/Machine. 
Enter the password for the Servers/Machine as will be asked. 
This is the last time you will enter the password while SSHing. Promise :)
