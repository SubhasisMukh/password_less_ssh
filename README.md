# password_less_ssh </br>
</br>
You can use this script to setup SSH without any password from your PC. </br>
Please run the script in a Linux terminal. </br>
For example open a terminal and run this command : </br>
#### bash sshsetup.sh </br>
</br>
First you have to enter the number of servers you want to setup passwordless ssh. Then put the username and IP address of the respective Servers/Machine. </br>
Enter the password for the Servers/Machine as will be asked. </br>
This is the last time you will enter the password while SSHing. Promise :)
